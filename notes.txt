        filter
        Given the optional third argument, N, ‘fftfilt’ uses the
        overlap-add method to filter X with B using an N-point FFT.  The
        FFT size must be an even power of 2 and must be greater than or
        equal to the length of B.  If the specified N does not meet these
        criteria, it is automatically adjusted to the nearest value that
        does.
